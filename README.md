# Math-Linguistics Python Project

## Description
In this project, I am experimenting with Python to explore math and language-related concepts. I started this because I noticed that, while these concepts can be solved manually, tackling them in code requires a different way of thinking!

## Libraries Used
- `colorama`
- `math`
- `os`

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the data analysis project, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Required Libraries
You will need to install the following Python libraries to run the project:
- colorama: `pip install colorama`

## Usage
This project does not require any specific configuration or command-line arguments. Simply download the files and run the Python script:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ../beginner_python
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
